Vincent Willem van Gogh (March 30, 1853 - July 29, 1890) was a Dutch painter from 
the late 19th century and one of the leading figures of Post-Impressionism. 
His work holds a significant place in art history due to its vibrant colors, 
emotional expression, and innovative brushwork. Van Gogh produced over 2,100 artworks 
in his lifetime, with the majority of them created in the two years leading up to his death. 
His most famous works include Starry Night, Sunflowers, and The Bedroom in Arles. 
Though he struggled with mental anguish and ended his life at the age of 37, 
his work gradually gained recognition after his death. Today, Van Gogh is regarded 
as one of the most highly esteemed painters in the world. His style had a profound influence 
on later movements such as Expressionism and Abstract Art, and his passionate and distinctive 
approach continues to inspire many.
